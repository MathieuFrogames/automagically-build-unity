# automagically-build-unity
Template example for building your Unity game for multiple platforms

**This will absolutely not work AS IS for your project**

I'm working on a Mac and building my project for the following platforms:
- Steam (Mac/PC)
- itch.io (Mac/PC)
- Mac App Store
- iOS 

Maybe this will help you a bit for your own project, probably not.
